# Minimal Front-End Project Setup

A small setup to get you started with a front-end project.

## Credits

This project is based on [Stephanie Eckles](https://thinkdobecreate.com/)'s [Minimum Static Site Setup With Sass](https://thinkdobecreate.com/articles/minimum-static-site-sass-setup/) and [Jessica Chan](https://coder-coder.com/)'s (Coder Coder) [Gulp-Sass-Boilerplate](https://github.com/thecodercoder/generator-gulp-sass-boilerplate).

## Usage

- Clone this repository whenever you are starting a new frontend project and run `npm install`.

## NPM Scripts

- `npm run watch`: Watches for changes in `scss` and `js` folders.
- `npm run start`: Starts the development server.
- `npm run build`: Builds the project for production.

## Notes

- If you are using 3rd party libraries, put them directly into the `dist/**` folder and link to the html files.
